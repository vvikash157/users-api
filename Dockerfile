# Smaller Image: The final image is lightweight (~5MB from Alpine + binary).
# Faster Builds: go.mod is copied first to leverage Docker's caching mechanism.
# Security: The final image doesnâ€™t include unnecessary files like source code.
# Portability: The binary is compiled statically (CGO_ENABLED=0), making it easy to run anywhere.  */
